# 50-MYSQL-LeetCode-Solutions
Throughout my journey on LeetCode, I've delved into the intricate world of MySQL with fervor, solving a total of 50 problems across various difficulty levels. From the fundamental concepts to more advanced techniques, I've honed my skills in database management and query optimization. Here's a glimpse into the breadth of topics I've covered:

- Basic Joins: Understanding how to merge tables effectively.

- Sorting and Grouping: Organizing data for better insights.
  
- Subqueries: Mastering the art of nested queries.

From the straightforward to the challenging, each problem has contributed to my proficiency in MySQL, equipping me with the skills to tackle real-world data management tasks with confidence. With a solid foundation in SQL queries and database manipulation, I'm ready to take on even more complex challenges and continue pushing the boundaries of my expertise.


# Why MYSQL
Choosing MySQL for your database needs offers several compelling reasons. First and foremost, MySQL is an open-source relational database management system, making it freely available to use and widely supported by a vast community of developers and contributors. Its robust features, scalability, and reliability make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small-scale projects to enterprise-level systems. Additionally, MySQL boasts excellent performance, efficient data storage, and seamless integration with various programming languages and platforms. Its ease of use and extensive documentation further simplify development and maintenance tasks, making MySQL a top choice for anyone seeking a powerful and user-friendly database solution.

 When I tackled MySQL problems on LeetCode, I didn't just solve themâ€”I also explained my thinking in detail. I've shared solutions for 50 challenges, each with a clear breakdown of why I chose certain methods and how they help make the code better.

If you search for "SherAfsar" among the solutions, you'll find more than just code. I've written explanations that make even the trickiest parts of MySQL easy to understand. Whether it's basic stuff like joining tables or more complicated tasks like using subqueries, I've made sure to explain everything step by step.

My goal is to help others learn, not just by giving answers, but by showing them how to think like a problem solver. I believe that sharing knowledge makes us all better, so I've put a lot of effort into making my explanations as clear as possible.
